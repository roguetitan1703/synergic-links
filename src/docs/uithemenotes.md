- **Monospace:** `Inconsolata`, `ui-monospace`, `SFMono-Regular`, `Menlo`, `Monaco`, `Consolas`, `Liberation Mono`, `Courier New`, `monospace`  
  _Usage:_ Code snippets and data-related elements.

### Font Sizes & Heading Hierarchy

- **Base Font Size:** 16px (`text-base`)
- **Heading 1 (H1):**
  - Size: `text-5xl` (approx. 3rem) or `text-6xl` for very prominent hero headlines.
  - Weight: Bold.
  - Color: Preferably `text-accent` for emphasis or `text-textLight` if needed for contrast.
- **Heading 2 (H2):**
  - Size: `text-4xl` (approx. 2.25rem).
  - Usage: Section headings.
- **Heading 3 (H3):**
  - Size: `text-3xl` (approx. 1.875rem).
  - Usage: Sub-headings within sections.
- **Heading 4 (H4):**
  - Size: `text-2xl` (approx. 1.5rem).
  - Usage: Minor headings or card titles.
- **Body Text:**
  - Size: `text-base` (16px) or `text-lg` (18px) for improved readability.

- **Letter Spacing:**
  - Default: `tracking-normal`.
  - For emphasis on headings, consider `tracking-wide`.

## 3. Spacing & Layout

### Margins and Paddings

- **Spacing Scale:** Use Tailwind’s default spacing scale (e.g., 4 = 1rem, 6 = 1.5rem, 8 = 2rem, 10 = 2.5rem, 12 = 3rem, etc.).
- **Hero Section:**
  - Padding: `p-8` on mobile, `p-16` on desktop.
  - Margin: Minimal margins are needed since it’s full-screen.
- **Headings & Paragraphs:**
  - Headings: `mb-4` for H1/H2, `mb-2` for smaller headings.
  - Paragraphs: `mb-4` or `mb-8` for sufficient separation.
- **Buttons:**
  - Padding: `py-3 px-6`.
  - Margin Top: `mt-6` to separate from adjacent content.
- **Cards (e.g., in Carousel):**
  - Use `gap-6` between grid items for consistency.

### Layout Guidelines

- **Hero Section:**
  - Full-screen (`h-screen`).
  - Background image without gradient (unless needed for contrast).
  - Center content vertically and horizontally.
- **Services Carousel:**
  - Each slide should use `min-w-full` so they align properly in a horizontal flex container.
  - Use consistent padding (`p-8` or `p-16`) to ensure content is evenly spaced.
- **Navbar & Other Components:**
  - Maintain consistent margins and padding to achieve a cohesive look across the site.
- **Responsive Design:**
  - Utilize responsive classes (`md:`, `lg:`) to adjust font sizes, spacing, and layout for different screen sizes.

## 4. Component-Specific Guidelines

### Hero Section

- **Background:** Use a high-quality background image covering the entire screen (`bg-cover bg-center`) without overusing gradients.
- **Overlay:** If needed for text contrast, use a subtle overlay with low opacity.
- **Content:**
  - Tag/Pill: Small label (e.g., “Enterprise-Grade Solutions”) using `bg-accent` with rounded-full and padding.
  - Headline: Bold, large, and centered with ample white space.
  - CTA Buttons: Use your accent for primary action, maintain hover states with smooth transitions.
  - Service Tags: Display key offerings in small badges or inline links for quick insight.

### Services Carousel

- **Layout:**
  - Each slide should have a solid background (`bg-darkBg`) or use a subtle gradient if needed.
  - Text on the left, image on the right on desktop; stack vertically on mobile.
- **Interactions:**
  - Auto-slide with pause on hover.
  - Navigation buttons with clear ARIA labels.
- **Animations:**
  - Smooth slide transitions using `transition-transform duration-500`.
  - Subtle hover effects on buttons and images to signal interactivity.

### Navbar

- **Dropdowns:**
  - Use a high z-index to ensure dropdowns appear above other elements.
  - Ensure dropdowns use a consistent background (e.g., matching the navbar’s gradient or a solid `bg-darkBg`) with clear spacing and transitions.
- **Buttons:**
  - Maintain consistent styling for the appointment button.
- **Typography:**
  - Consistent font sizes and spacing as defined in the global guidelines.
- **Accessibility:**
  - Include ARIA labels and focus states for interactive elements.

## 5. Additional Best Practices

- **Accessibility:** Ensure color contrast meets WCAG guidelines; use ARIA labels where applicable.
- **Consistency:**
  - Create reusable components that reference these design tokens.
  - Document any custom classes or utility functions in your codebase.
- **Performance:** Optimize images and avoid overly complex animations.
- **Testing:** Verify design consistency across different devices and screen sizes using responsive design testing tools.
